# GifTastic

GifTastic is dynamic web page that brings TV Show Gifs straight to the user, using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, **jQuery**, **APIs**, and **AJAX Requests**. This project uses the GIPHY API to populate the page with gifs related to TV Shows. The page loads with a selection of TV Show buttons that the user can choose from, but also allows the user to add additional shows/buttons.

When a user clicks a TV Show button, 10 related gifs will populate as static, non-animated gif images. To bring an image to life, just click it one time! To return the animated gif back to a still image, simply click the gif again.
